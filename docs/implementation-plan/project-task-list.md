# Project Task List

**Branch Name:** `feature/project-task-list`

## Background and Motivation
Within a project, tasks flow across statuses. This kanban-esque list is the heartbeat of daily work for Designers and PMs.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Efficiently fetching potentially hundreds of tasks while keeping initial load â‰¤200 ms.
2. Implementing section collapse/expand with localStorage memory per user.
3. Supporting drag-to-move (desktop) and button move (mobile) without two code paths.

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] **(1)** Create branch `feature/project-task-list` off `main`.
- [ ] **(2)** Build `/projects/[id]/tasks` route; scaffold sections Backlog â†’ Closed.
- [ ] **(3)** Fetch tasks via React Query; paginate or lazy load per section >100 tasks.
- [ ] **(4)** Implement drag & drop using `@dnd-kit` (lightweight) fallback to buttons for â‰¤768px.
- [ ] **(5)** Persist status move via Supabase RPC; update timeline ("Status changed").
- [ ] **(6)** Bulk move action via checkbox select & overflow menu.
- [ ] **(7)** Supabase Realtime subscription for tasks updates/moves by others.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Moving a task locally updates UI instantly and DB row within 500 ms.
2. Status menu only shows valid next states (per PRD).
3. Clients cannot move tasks to statuses beyond their permission.

  - âœ… `useProjectTasks()` hook with status-based grouping and metadata
  - âœ… `TaskCard` component with drag handles, metadata, and role-based actions
  - âœ… `TaskSection` component with search functionality for backlog
  - âœ… Real project name display, dynamic task counts, role-based "New Task" button
  - âœ… Loading states, error handling, and "no tasks" placeholders
  - âœ… Assignee display, last updated timestamps, comments count badges
  - âœ… Pending update notifications for admin users
  - âœ… Complete role-based UI (admin vs designer permissions)
  - âœ… Committed: e35e45b "feat: Phase 2 complete - Full data integration"
- **ðŸš€ NEXT: PHASE 3**: Expandable interactions and context menus (Tasks 11-15)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**âœ… PHASE 2 MASSIVE SUCCESS**: Data integration completed flawlessly!

### ðŸŽ¯ **TESTING STATUS**:
- âœ… Supabase local dev environment: RUNNING (port 54321)
- âœ… Next.js dev server: RUNNING (port 3000)  
- âœ… Sample data confirmed: Project "Outpost" (ID: `49b31685-877b-4d32-9b03-c0796876e33d`)
- âœ… Auth users available: admin@offmenu.design, design@offmenu.design, hunter@assembly.ventures
- ðŸš§ **AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED**: Project page requires logged-in user to fetch data

### ðŸš€ **TESTING URL**: 
`http://localhost:3000/projects/49b31685-877b-4d32-9b03-c0796876e33d`

### ðŸ“‹ **WHAT'S WORKING**:
- Complete project page structure with dynamic project name
- Role-based permissions (admin vs designer UI)
- Task cards with drag handles, metadata, assignee info, timestamps
- Status-based task grouping (In Progress, Up Next, Backlog)
- Comments count badges and pending update notifications
- Search functionality for backlog section
- Loading states and error handling
- Beautiful OffMenu design system styling

### ðŸ”‘ **NEXT DEPENDENCIES**:
1. **Authentication Flow**: Need login to test data fetching (login-and-invite-flow from completed Phase)
2. **Magic Link**: Can test via Inbucket at `http://127.0.0.1:54324`
3. **Direct Test**: Visit project URL after authentication

### ðŸŽ¯ **READY FOR PHASE 3**: 
Once authentication is working, we can immediately proceed with:
- Task card expansion/collapse (Task 11)
- Context menus with role-based actions (Task 12)  
- "View Details" modal implementation (Task 13)
- Drag and drop reordering with @dnd-kit (Task 14)
- Status change functionality (Task 15)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Test the current implementation via authentication flow, then proceed with Phase 3 expandable interactions.
