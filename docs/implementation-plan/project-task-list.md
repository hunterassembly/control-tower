# Project Task List

**Branch Name:** `feature/project-task-list`

## Background and Motivation
This is the **primary workspace** where authenticated users land after login. Based on the UI analysis, this is a sophisticated task management interface that serves as the daily hub for Designers and PMs. Users are redirected here after successful invite redemption (fixing our current 404 issue).

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### UI Complexity Analysis (Based on Screenshot)
The interface includes multiple sophisticated features:

1. **Multi-tab Navigation**: Tasks, Overview, Assets tabs with active state management
2. **Advanced Task Cards**: Expandable/collapsible with rich metadata, notifications, and contextual actions
3. **Status-based Organization**: In Progress, Up Next, Backlog sections with different layouts
4. **Real-time Updates**: Notification banners for pending approvals and task updates
5. **Role-based Permissions**: Different actions available based on user role (admin vs designer)
6. **Advanced Interactions**: Drag-and-drop, context menus, inline actions, search, filtering

### Technical Challenges
1. **Performance**: Efficiently rendering potentially hundreds of tasks with rich UI
2. **Real-time Updates**: Live notifications and status changes from other users
3. **Complex State Management**: Task status, expand/collapse, filters, selections
4. **Role-based UI**: Conditionally showing actions based on user permissions
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Adapting complex desktop interactions for mobile

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Structure & Navigation
- [ ] **(1)** Create branch `feature/project-task-list` off `main`

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Complete User Journey**: Login â†’ Invite Redemption â†’ Task Page (no 404s)
2. **Role-based Experience**: Admins see approval/creation controls, Designers see task details
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live notifications when tasks are updated by others
4. **Performance**: Initial load <500ms, smooth interactions
5. **Mobile Responsive**: All features work on mobile with appropriate adaptations
6. **Task Management**: Create, update, approve, delete, reorder, search, filter

### Color System Ready:
- Task status colors mapped to database enums
- Role-based action button colors
- Notification and alert styling
- Interactive state transitions

**RECOMMENDATION**: Proceed with Phase 1 (Tasks 1-5) - create branch and basic structure with the design system classes.
