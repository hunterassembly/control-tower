# Task Detail & Updates

**Branch Name:** `feature/task-detail-and-updates`

## Background and Motivation
The task detail page is the heart of the design workflow. Designers submit updates with Loom videos, Figma links, and files. Clients review them here with a clean timeline view. A smooth flow here means fewer "Where's the latest file?" messages and faster feedback loops.

**DESIGN ANALYSIS**: The mockup shows a sophisticated 70/30 split layout with a comprehensive update review system, rich timeline display, and role-based action flows.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Complex Update Review Workflow**: Blue notification banners, different update types (Design/Status/Follow-up), role-based "Review Update" buttons
2. **Rich Timeline Display**: Chronological updates with avatars, timestamps, status badges, summaries, and comment counts
3. **Multi-file Upload System**: Supabase Storage + signed URLs, progress feedback, thumbnail generation
4. **Role-Based UI**: Different actions for Designers vs Reviewers/Clients vs Admins
5. **Real-time Notifications**: Update status changes need to trigger notifications and timeline entries
6. **Responsive Embed Rendering**: Figma, Loom embeds with secure CSP headers
7. **Audit Trail**: Immutable timeline with payload JSON for complete history
