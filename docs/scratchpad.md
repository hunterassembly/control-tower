### Lessons Learned

_Add new items to the list below as `- [YYYY-MM-DD] Your wisdom here`_

- [2025-05-19] Initial project scaffolding created by Planner.
- [2025-05-19] GitHub Actions removed from project scope per user request - using manual verification and testing instead for MVP.
- [2025-05-19] When applying new Supabase migrations, use direct psql application instead of `supabase db reset` to avoid data loss.
- [2025-05-19] Next.js HMR can fail when converting server components to client components ("use client"). Fix: kill dev server, rm -rf .next, restart npm run dev.
- [2025-05-19] Magic-link authentication flow tested successfully: login form ‚Üí Supabase email ‚Üí Inbucket ‚Üí magic link click ‚Üí redirect to /projects.
- [2025-05-23] MAJOR MILESTONE: Complete end-to-end invite token redemption flow working! Fixed RLS infinite recursion by removing cross-table queries in project_member policies. localStorage approach successfully preserves invite tokens through magic link redirects. Invitation system is production-ready pending Edge Function deployment.
- [2025-05-23] UI COMPLEXITY DISCOVERY: The "project task list" is actually the main project page (/projects/[id]) where users land after authentication. Screenshot analysis reveals 28+ sophisticated features including expandable task cards, role-based actions, real-time notifications, drag-and-drop, approval workflows, and multi-tab navigation. This is the primary workspace, not a simple dashboard.
- [2025-05-23] EXCELLENT SCHEMA ALIGNMENT: Database schema analysis shows perfect alignment with UI requirements. All sophisticated features (comments, updates, approvals, status tracking, role-based permissions) are already supported by existing tables and enums. No schema changes needed for implementation.
- [2025-05-23] DESIGN SYSTEM FOUNDATION: Created comprehensive OffMenu design system in globals.css with 50+ CSS custom properties matching screenshot UI. Includes component classes, status colors, interactive states, and dark mode support. Using modern oklch color space and Tailwind CSS v4 approach for optimal performance and maintainability.
- [2025-01-27] 400 API errors during development are often EXPECTED SECURITY BEHAVIOR when authentication is required. Always check if user needs to login first at `/login` before assuming there's a bug.
- [2025-01-27] When users successfully authenticate but get "access denied" errors, check if they have project_member records. Successful auth ‚â† project access. Use: `psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" -c "SELECT pm.role, au.email FROM project_member pm JOIN auth.users au ON pm.user_id = au.id;"`
- [2025-01-27] Always verify the correct port for Next.js dev server with `lsof -i :3000` - don't assume port numbers. Default is 3000, not 3001!
- [2025-01-27] When auth issues are complex, add comprehensive debugging FIRST: console logs in hooks, visual debug displays, and auth state monitoring. This saves hours of guessing. Use prefixed emojis (üîç, üîê, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå) for easy filtering.
- [2025-01-27] 400 API errors that look like auth problems can actually be database schema mismatches! Always check if the code's expected columns/enums match the actual database structure. Use `\d table_name` in psql to verify schema. In this case: missing `position` column, wrong status enum values (`'Backlog'` vs `'backlog'`), and missing project columns caused all the 400s.
- [2025-01-27] **Planner Mode**: Always do comprehensive design analysis BEFORE starting implementation. The initial task-detail plan was way too high-level (7 tasks) vs the detailed mockup analysis (32 tasks across 8 phases). Thorough planning prevents scope creep and ensures nothing gets missed. Extract every UI element, interaction, and user flow from designs.
- [2025-01-27] **Merge Conflicts**: When merging feature branches with different implementations of the same files (supabase.ts, projects/page.tsx), prefer the more comprehensive version that includes debugging, helper functions, and better functionality. Keep valuable pieces from both versions when possible.
- [2025-01-27] **Successful Merge Resolution**: Project task list feature branch successfully merged to main! Key strategy: resolve conflicts systematically (supabase.ts merged helper functions, projects/page.tsx kept functional version, globals.css merged complete design system). Always remove package-lock.json conflicts and regenerate via npm install. Use git add . then git commit to complete merge.
